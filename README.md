# A simple python IRC bot

I created this repository because i needed a IRC bot for some Root-Me challenge.

I decided to create only one program to reply to all challenge based on IRC.

This bot is made with pure python 2.7 and do not require any other third party stuff

This is written in pure interest to make this code evolve.

Please do not use this code to cheat, you will not get any pleasure to do so.

# Usage

To start the bot just execute python bot.py
